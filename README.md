# rock-paper-scissors

A rock-paper-scissors game against the computer. The code will be in JS.

Already created the functions to obtain the string decisions for both the user and the computer.

The game is now complete and (thanks to ChatGPT) can handle an error on which the user writes a value in the prompt that is not 1,2 or 3.
