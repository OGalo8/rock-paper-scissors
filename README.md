# rock-paper-scissors

A rock-paper-scissors game against the computer. The code will be in JS.

Already created the functions to obtain the string decisions for both the user and the computer.

The game is now complete and (thanks to ChatGPT) can handle an error on which the user writes a value in the prompt that is not 1,2 or 3.

Changed some of the dynamics of the functions to shape them according to what the initial problem in The Odin Project asked.

Added the overall winner of the game as a console message.
